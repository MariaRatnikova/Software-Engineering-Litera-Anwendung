  "kommentar" : "Collins delivers a compelling story with The Hunger Games. The concept of a televised death game is chilling but brilliantly executed. Katniss is a fascinating character—flawed but brave—and the relationships are believable. Some parts felt rushed, and I wish there had been more world-building outside the Games. Still, the suspense and emotion kept me hooked. It’s a powerful critique of society, entertainment, and inequality wrapped in an exciting young adult narrative. I’d recommend it to teens and adults alike.",
